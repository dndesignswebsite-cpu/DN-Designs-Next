                  <h2>Planning Your Brand</h2>
                  <p>
                    It’s now time to create your brand strategy. Every aspect of
                    branding is carefully thought out and discussed with you -
                    be it your brand personality, story, message, values, or
                    even communication and website design. As a creative
                    branding agency, we decide on these elements based on how we
                    want the audience to perceive your brand.

                    Let’s turn words and ideas into action. We now sit down to
                    do the actual work - naming your brand, designing your logo,
                    creating your packaging design, crafting a tagline,
                    composing your message, and much more. In addition, we
                    design and develop your website too.

                  <p>
                    The final stage in our branding journey, this is where we
                    seek a review of our work. Based on your feedback, we make
                    changes, and reseek your feedback. Once we receive a green
                    light from you, we go ahead and launch your brand.
