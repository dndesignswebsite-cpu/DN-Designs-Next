                <h2>Importance of Packaging Design in Bangalore</h2>
                <p>
                  Over the year, Bangalore, or Bengaluru, as it is now known,
                  has become a megacity. The market has evolved, customers'
                  expectations have increased, and the competition has become
                  tougher. Branding and packaging design have therefore gained
                  more prominence. With just a few seconds to capture consumers’
                  attention, brands need product packaging designs that are both
                  visually stunning and effectively convey their brand identity
                  and values.
